Now that you've installed PaypalPermissions, the first thing you'll need
to do is add your PayPal login, password, signature, and app_id to the
config/environments/*.rb files.

Then, you can create a new model with routes, or a migration to modify
an existing model to support your application's interactions with the
PayPal Permissions API.

Try:
  rails generate paypal_permissions <model> [field_name:field_type ...]
